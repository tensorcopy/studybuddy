## What is StudyBuddy?

StudyBuddy is a technical blog born from study sessions. When I dig into a topic — transformers, training dynamics, quantization, RLHF — I write up what I learn as a long-form article. The goal is to build genuine understanding, not skim the surface.

## What to expect

Each post aims to be:

- **Deep** — 4,000–10,000+ words covering a topic from fundamentals to frontier
- **Technical** — Real math, real code, real experiments where possible
- **Honest** — Clear about what I know, what I'm speculating on, and what I got wrong
- **Practical** — Concrete takeaways you can use in your own work

## The process

Posts start as study notes and research briefs, then get shaped into structured articles. The writing workflow is agent-assisted using Claude Code with custom commands for research, drafting, and validation.
